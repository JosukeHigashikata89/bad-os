BadOs is an operating system that pushes the definition of lightweight to the extreme.
It uses as little code as possible to make it lighter than anti-matter. 
BadOs will have 2 versions: one with no gui and just a command prompt and another with gui's. 
The file extension is currently: .(none)
If you destroy your pc with this, thats your fault. Don't put the blame on us you're the one who downloaded and installed it without reading this first.
BadOs has no antivirus so you have to make sure you know what you're installing. We have absolutley no liability for what you install and run. 
BadOs is extremely experimental so always run it on a virtual machine until a stable version is released. 
BadOs has no affiliation with BaDos or Bados Pizza Grille and Ale Shop
